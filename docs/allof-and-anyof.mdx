# AllOf and AnyOf

The platform supports **AllOf** and **AnyOf** operations to handle JSON schemas effectively. These features provide flexibility in schema design and mapping by combining or selecting schema properties based on specific conditions.

## **AllOf**

**Description**

- The **AllOf** operation allows users to import and combine multiple schema properties into a single schema.
- This operation merges the properties from multiple schemas, ensuring that the resulting schema includes all specified properties.

**How It Works**

1. **Import Schema Properties**
   - Users can import schema properties using the **AllOf** operation.
   - The platform provides out-of-the-box support for combining all specified properties.
2. **Schema Creation**
   - Once imported, the platform automatically creates a new schema that includes all the combined properties.

## **AnyOf**

**Description**

- The **AnyOf** operation allows users to define flexible mappings by selecting a single property from a list of options.
- This operation enables users to choose specific nodes for mapping based on their requirements.

**How It Works**

1. **Node Selection**
   - Users can navigate to the **Input Tabs** to view available schema properties.
   - Click on the **three dots** next to the desired node to open the condition selection menu.
2. **Select the Desired Condition**
   - From the menu, choose the specific condition or node to map.
3. **Manual Mapping**
   - After selecting a node, users must manually map the selected property to the desired target schema.
