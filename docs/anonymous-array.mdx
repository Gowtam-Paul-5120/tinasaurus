title: Anonymous Array
---

# Anonymous Array

The **Anonymous Array** feature allows users to toggle between an object and an array schema in the **Input** and **Output** tabs of a workflow. This flexibility ensures that workflows can handle dynamic data structures efficiently, adapting to scenarios where arrays are required instead of objects.

---

## Configuring Anonymous Arrays

The **Input** and **Output** tabs in the workflow provide a toggle option to switch the schema body from an object to an array. This toggle is particularly useful when working with data structures that involve lists or collections.

**Steps to Enable Anonymous Arrays**

1. **Navigate to the Input or Output Tab**
   - Open the workflow and go to either the **Input** or **Output** tab, depending on where you need to configure the schema.
2. **Locate the Toggle**
   - In the schema configuration area, find the **Toggle** option that allows switching between **Object** and **Array** modes.
3. **Switch to Array**
   - Turn on the toggle to enable the array schema. This will change the schema body from an object structure to an array structure.
4. **Save Changes**
   - After configuring the schema as an array, save your workflow to apply the changes.

## Behavior of Anonymous Arrays

When the schema is toggled to an array, the following changes occur

1. **Structure Change**
   - The schema changes from a single object representation to a collection format, allowing multiple items to be processed as part of an array.
2. **Dynamic Compatibility**
   - The array schema enables seamless handling of data sets, such as lists of objects or values, without requiring predefined array keys.

## Example Use Case

**Scenario**

A workflow needs to process a list of user details, such as multiple user objects containing `name`, `email`, and `age`.

**Steps**

1. Configure the **Input Tab** schema to enable the array toggle.
2. Map the incoming data as an array of objects

   ```json
   jsonCopy code[
       {
           "name": "John",
           "email": "john@example.com",
           "age": 30
       },
       {
           "name": "Jane",
           "email": "jane@example.com",
           "age": 25
       }
   ]
   ```

3. In the **Output Tab**, ensure that the schema is also toggled to handle arrays if required.
