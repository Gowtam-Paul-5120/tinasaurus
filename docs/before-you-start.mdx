# Before You Start

When you log in, you automatically join a public workspace, where you can easily create applications and workflows.

You can create your first workflow even in an existing application, but we recommend you create your own application, just to be safe.&#x20;

## Create Your Application

1. Click **Create Application** in the Home page, or\
   Go to the **Applications** page from the main menu and click **Create Application**.\
   \
   The **Create Application** modal appears.
2. Click **New Application**.\
   The **Create Application** modal appears.
3. Enter a name for your application (e.g., _HelloWorld_) and specify other details as appropriate.
4. Click **Create**.\
   Your application is now ready, and you can [add workflows](create-your-first-workflow.mdx) into it.

**Delete after checking with Basanth.**

Once your workspace and application are ready, you're set to start building workflows in **PlatformNX**!
