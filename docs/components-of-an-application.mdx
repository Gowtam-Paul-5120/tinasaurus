# Components of an Application

#### **Workspace**

The Workspace is the main environment where applications are built, managed, and organized. It provides access to all essential components required for workflow development.

**Applications**

Applications are individual solutions created within the workspace. They consist of various elements designed to automate processes and integrate systems.

* **Workflows**\
  Workflows define the sequence of operations or processes within an application. They outline how data moves and actions are performed.
  * **Activities**\
    Activities are the core tasks or functions in a workflow, such as sending a request, processing data, or triggering an event.
    * **Mappings**\
      Mappings are configurations within activities that define how data is transferred from one step to another. They link output values from one activity to the input fields of another.
  * **Transition Lines**\
    Transition lines visually connect activities, showing the logical flow and sequence of operations in the workflow.
  * **Groups**\
    Groups help organize and manage related activities and components within workflows for better clarity and structure.

**Resources**

Resources are reusable configurations or services (e.g., API connections, authentication settings) that support workflow execution.

**Schemas**

Schemas define the structure and format of data used within workflows, ensuring consistency in data handling.

**Variable Groups**

Variable groups are collections of related variables used to store and manage data across workflows.

* **Variables**\
  Variables hold dynamic data that can be used and updated throughout the workflow, enabling flexible and dynamic operations.
