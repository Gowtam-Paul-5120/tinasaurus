# Conditional Mapping

Conditional mapping in the platform enables flexible and dynamic data processing for **JSON schemas**. By supporting robust mapping techniques, the platform simplifies complex operations and ensures seamless data transformations. The platform supports three types of conditional mappings

## **1. If-Else Condition**

- **Description**: Executes a block of logic based on the evaluation of a condition.
- **Use Case**: Apply specific logic when a condition is true; otherwise, execute alternative logic.
- **Example**
  - For a JSON schema, if the `age` field is greater than 18, map "adult"; else, map "minor."

---

## **2. For-Each Condition**

- **Description**: Iterates over a JSON array and applies a specific mapping to each element.
- **Use Case**: Transform and map data for each item in a JSON list.
- **Example**
  - For each item in an order array, map the `itemName` and `price` to the target system.

## **3. Switch Condition**

- **Description**: Executes a block of logic based on multiple conditions (cases).
- **Use Case**: Handle scenarios where multiple outcomes are possible for JSON field values.
- **Example**
  - For a JSON field `role`
    - Map "Admin" if the role is `1`.
    - Map "Editor" if the role is `2`.
    - Map "Viewer" if the role is `3`.
