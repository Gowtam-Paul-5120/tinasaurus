# Creating and Using a Subflow

A **Subflow** is a modular and reusable workflow that operates as a component within a larger primary workflow. Subflows encapsulate specific tasks or processes, enabling streamlined management, reduced complexity, and improved maintainability of workflows. They allow data exchange and execution synchronization with the main workflow, supporting scalability and modular design in automation systems.

### **Steps to Configure Subflows**

#### **1. Create and Configure the Subflow Workflow**

1. **Create Subflow**
   - Navigate to your application’s **Workflow** section.
   - Create a new workflow and name it descriptively (e.g., `Subflow`).
2. **Design Subflow**

   - Add the necessary activities to define the subprocesses.
   - Configure the `Start Activity` to define an **Input Schema** for data received from the parent workflow.
   - Configure the `End Activity` to define an **Output Schema** for returning results to the parent workflow.

#### **2. Add Subflow Activity to the Parent Workflow**

1. Open the parent workflow (e.g., `MainFlow`).
2. Drag and drop the **Subflow Activity** from the Activity menu onto the canvas.
3. Link the Subflow Activity to the `Subflow` you created
   - Use the dropdown in the Subflow Activity’s settings to select the desired subflow.
4. Map data

   - Connect the inputs of the parent workflow to the `Subflow Activity` inputs.
   - Map the outputs of the `Subflow Activity` to subsequent activities in the parent workflow.

#### **3. Configure Execution Behavior**

1. Open the Subflow Activity configuration panel within the parent workflow.
2. Enable **Wait for Completion** if the parent workflow must pause until the subflow finishes.
3. Disable this option for asynchronous subflow execution.

   > **GIF Suggestion:** Demonstrate toggling the `Wait for Completion` option.
