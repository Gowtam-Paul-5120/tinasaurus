title: For Each Loop
---

# For Each Loop

The For Each loop iterates over variables in an array. The array to iterate over is specified in the 'Iterate On' field of the group configuration and can be sourced from any activityâ€™s output prior to the start of the loop. This loop is ideal for operations where each item in a collection needs to be processed individually.

#### Configuration Options
