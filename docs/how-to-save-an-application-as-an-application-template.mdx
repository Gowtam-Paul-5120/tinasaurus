# How to save an application as an application template?

## What is an application template?

Application template involves saving an existing application as a reusable framework. This ensures that future applications can be quickly built on the same structure without starting from scratch.

### **Steps to create Application template.**

1.  **Select an Application**

    - Open the platform and locate the application you want to use as the base for your template.
    - Click on the **Save as Template** option available in the menu or toolbar associated with the application.

2.  **Add Details & Preview**

    - Fill in all required details, such as the template name (e.g., _Vendor Relationship Manager_) and a meaningful description that highlights its purpose.
    - Verify the configurations during the preview step to ensure accuracy.
    - Click **Next** to proceed to the publishing step.

3.  **Publish Template**

    - Click the **Publish** button to save the application template. Once published, it becomes accessible to users across your organization.

4.  **Access Created Template**

    - To confirm the template's creation, go to the **Artifacts** section, where all saved templates are stored.
    - Search for the new template by its name and ensure it appears in the list.
