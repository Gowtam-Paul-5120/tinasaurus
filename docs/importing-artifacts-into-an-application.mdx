# Importing Artifacts into an Application

Importing an application restores workflows, resources, and schemas from a previously exported file.

### To import an application

- Navigate to the **Applications** section, right-click, and select **Import Application**.
- Upload the file and confirm. If an application with the same name exists, youâ€™ll be prompted to rename or overwrite it.

**Note:** Imported applications bring all associated data into the platform. Ensure the file matches your target environment to prevent conflicts.
