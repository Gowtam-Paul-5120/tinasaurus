# Managing Applications

Create: Need clarification&#x20;

In the Build Your First Application section, you learned how to create an application as the first step. Once your application is set up, there are additional actions you can perform to manage it effectively, such as renaming, deleting, importing, and exporting applications. Hereâ€™s how you can do each\
\
1.Rename an Application

Renaming an application updates its name across the platform, ensuring consistency across workflows, endpoints, and test cases.

To rename an application

- Right-click on the application in the list and select **Rename**.
- Enter the new name and click **Save** to confirm.

**Note:** Renaming automatically reflects the new name across all references. This does not affect functionality but ensures better organization. Choose names carefully to maintain clarity.

### 2.Delete an Application

Deleting an application permanently removes it along with all its workflows, resources, and schemas.

To delete an application

- Right-click on the application and select **Delete**.
- Confirm the action in the popup.

**Note:** This action is irreversible. Any workflows or dependencies tied to the application will be lost. To avoid data loss, export the application before deleting if needed.
