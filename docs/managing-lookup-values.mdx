# Managing Lookup Values

## What is a lookup table?

A **Lookup Table** stores data in a key-value format. It allows workflows to quickly retrieve data based on specific keys.

Lookup Tables are available at the **Workspace** level.&#x20;

Use Lookup Tables to manage static or reusable data for workflows.

## How do lookup tables, vaults, workspaces, and environments work together?

In **PlatformNX**, Lookup Tables, Vaults, Workspaces, and Environments work together to provide a structured, secure, and scalable way to manage applications and workflows.

[**Workspaces**](../../) organize applications, workflows, and resources in a shared space. They help teams manage related applications and control access.

[**Lookup Tables** ](./)store reusable key-value data. All applications in a workspace can access this data to build workflows.

[**Vaults**](../managing-secrets/) securely store sensitive information, such as passwords and tokens. Workflows can access this data without exposing it.

**Environments** manage configuration settings for different stages (Development, Production).&#x20;
