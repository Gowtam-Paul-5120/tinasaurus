# Managing Members

Efficient management of members and permissions is critical for maintaining secure and collaborative workflows within any organization. The platform provides a comprehensive system that allows administrators to invite users based on roles, assign permissions at both the organizational and workspace levels, and ensure seamless collaboration across teams. Role-based invitations and granular access control empower organizations to maintain robust security and operational efficiency.
