# Permission Management

Permission management in the platform provides a robust framework to control access and manage resources effectively. It is divided into **Organization-Level Permissions** and **Workspace-Level Permissions** to ensure streamlined operations and security. This guide explains the roles and permissions structure, empowering administrators to allocate access rights precisely.

---

## **Roles**

The platform supports three primary roles, each designed for specific responsibilities

1. **Admin**
   - Full access to all organization and workspace features.
   - Manages users, permissions, workflows, and resources.
   - Can assign roles to other users.
2. **User**
   - Collaborates on resources within assigned workspaces.
   - Creates, updates, and manages workflows, schemas, and other resources.
   - Cannot assign roles or manage users.
3. **Client**
   - Restricted to consuming resources like APIs and published schemas.
   - Limited interaction for enhanced security.

## **Permissions**

Permissions are categorized into **Organization-Level** and **Workspace-Level** for efficient access control. Each category is further broken down into subcategories for clarity.\

**Permission Assignment**

- **Member Permissions**: Permissions are assigned to individual users based on their roles and responsibilities.
- **Team Permissions**: Permissions are assigned to a team, automatically granting access to all team members. Teams are ideal for managing permissions in collaborative settings.
