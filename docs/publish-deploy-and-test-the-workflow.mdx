# Publish, Deploy and Test the Workflow

- Publishing, deploying, and testing are the final steps to make your workflows and applications ready for use.
- **Publishing** saves a version of the workflow and prepares it for deployment.
- **Deployment** moves the workflow to a specific environment, like Development or Production.
- **Testing** checks that the workflow works correctly before others start using it.\

## Publishing, Deploying and Testing: Step-by-Step

1. **Publish and Deploy**

   - Click **Publish** to save your workflow and **Deploy** to make it live and accessible.
