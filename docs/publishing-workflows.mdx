### **2. Deploy**

**What is Deployment?**

- Deployment executes a published version of a workflow in a target environment.
- Users can deploy workflows as a **Secured API** or **Public API** in the **Development** environment by default.

**Deployment Options**

1. **Secured API**\
   Provides restricted access to the workflow, requiring authentication such as API keys or tokens.
2. **Public API**\
   Offers open access to the workflow without authentication, ideal for public-facing use cases.

**Steps to Deploy a Workflow**

1. **Access the Deployment Page**
   - Navigate to the **Deploy Page** via the workflow interface.
2. **Select Deployment API Type**
   - Choose **Secured API** or **Public API** based on the workflowâ€™s access requirements.

### **3. Promote**

**What is Promotion?**

- Promotion transitions a deployed workflow from the **Development** environment to the **Production** environment.
- This process is managed through the **Promote** button on the **Deploy Page** and requires approval from designated approvers.

**Steps to Promote a Workflow**

1. **Access the Promote Option**
   - Navigate to the **Deploy Page** and locate the deployed workflow.
   - Click the **Promote** button next to the workflow.
2. **Request Approval**
   - Clicking **Promote** sends an approval request to designated users.
   - Approvers review the workflow and either approve or reject the request.
3. **Complete Promotion**
   - Upon receiving all necessary approvals, the workflow is promoted to the **Production** environment.
