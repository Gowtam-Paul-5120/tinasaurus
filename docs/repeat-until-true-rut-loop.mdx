# Repeat Until True (RUT) Loop

Similar to the While loop, the Repeat Until True loop executes at least once and continues until a specified true condition is met. This loop can also use outputs from activities within the group to evaluate the condition.

> Usage: This loop is useful when the group of activities needs to be executed at least once and may continue based on a dynamic condition checked after each iteration.
