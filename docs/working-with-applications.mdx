# Working with Applications

## What's an application?

Applications enable you to streamline and automate workflows.&#x20;

An application is an organized collection of workflows and everything else that a workflow needs to function.&#x20;

## What does an application contain?

In PlatformNX, an application is displayed as a folder containing the following subfolders:

- [**Workflows**](../working-with-workflows/): Define the sequence of activities required to automate specific business processes. For example, employee onboarding.
- [**Resources**](resources.mdx): Enable secure and efficient interactions with external systems and services. They are reusable and configurable entities that can be used across multiple workflows within the application. For example, authentication records that can be invoked whenever required.
- [**Schemas**](schemas.mdx): Define the structure and format of data used within an application. They ensure data consistency, validation, and reusability across workflows.

Together, these components make applications in PlatformNX powerful, scalable, and easy to manage.

## Best Practices

- **Always export your application before deleting it.** This way, you can recover your application if needed.
- **Use clear naming conventions.** When renaming applications, choose descriptive names for better organization. For example, Fetch_Employee_Details, and not Get1.
- **Validate Imports.** Verify that imported files match your platform environment to avoid errors or conflicts.
- **Take regular backups.** Regularly export critical applications to protect against data loss and ensure business continuity.
