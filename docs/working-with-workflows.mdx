# Working with Workflows

A **Workflow** is a sequence of activities and tasks designed to automate processes and manage data flow between various systems and services. It ensures streamlined, efficient, and consistent execution of business operations.

### **4. Import a Workflow**

Workflows can be imported from the **Application Level**, restoring their activities, configurations, and data mappings.

**Steps**

1. Navigate to the **Applications** section.
2. Right-click on the application where you want to import the workflow and select **Import Application**.
3. Upload the `.json` file containing the workflow.
4. Confirm the import process. The workflow will appear in the application's **Workflow Folder**.

**Note:** Ensure the imported workflow matches your platform environment to prevent conflicts.

### **5. Export a Workflow**

Exporting a workflow creates a backup of its activities, configurations, and mappings.

**Steps**

1. Right-click on the workflow and select **Export Workflow**.
2. Save the `.json` file to your system for backup or reuse.

**Note:** Exported files allow workflows to be restored or shared across environments seamlessly.

### **6. Workflow Layout**

The Workflow Layout provides a visual representation of the workflow's logic and sequence, making it easy to design and configure processes.

#### **Key Components**

- **Canvas Area**: Central space where activities are placed and connected.
- **Activity Menu**: A menu on the left containing all available triggers, activities, and connectors.
- **Error Panel**: Displays errors identified during workflow validation or testing.
- **Validate Button**: A tool to ensure the workflow configuration is correct before publishing or deployment.

#### **Canvas Actions**

The canvas includes tools to enhance navigation and organization

- **Group**: Combine multiple activities into a single group for better organization.
- **Ungroup**: Break down a grouped set of activities back into individual elements.
- **Rotate**: Change the orientation of selected activities for easier arrangement.
- **Zoom In/Zoom Out**: Adjust the zoom level of the canvas to focus on specific areas.
- **Fit View**: Automatically adjust the canvas to fit all activities within the visible area.

### **Best Practices**

- **Export Before Deletion**: Always export workflows before deleting to ensure recoverability.
- **Clear Naming Conventions**: Use descriptive names when renaming workflows for better identification.
- **Validate Imports**: Ensure the imported workflows are compatible with your environment to avoid errors.
- **Test Before Deployment**: Regularly test workflows to ensure they function as expected.
