# Working with Workspaces

## What is a workspace?

The **Workspace** feature in PlatformNX is designed to facilitate seamless collaboration and efficient management of shared Application and Workflows. This feature provides users with a structured environment to organize resources, control access, and collaborate effectively within shared spaces. The following sections outline how to access, create, and manage workspaces.

_**Talk about public and private workspaces, and offer pointers on what kind of workspaces can be left public.**_

### Accessing Workspaces
